# Signature-Verification-

Project Algorithm
1.	Insert the signature
2.	Pre-process the signature by resizing, cropping etc.
3.  Extract the features
4.	Calculate the Euclidean distance between images
5.	Compare the distance between similar signatures and different signatures

## Result-
The  Euclidean distance between similar signatures is 15.units.
The Euclidean distance between different signatures can vary.
